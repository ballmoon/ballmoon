### `whoami`

Senior Blockchain Engineer
Multi-chain architect • Smart-contract artisan • Gas whisperer

I write code that travels across **Ethereum**, **Base**, **Solana**, **Polygon**
to create **identity**, **reputation**, and **value** where no single chain rules.

### `stack`

```
> chains:      Ethereum | Base | Polygon | Solana
> languages:   Solidity | Rust | TypeScript
> protocols:   L2 (Optimism/Arbitrum/Base) | DeFi (Uniswap/Aave/Compound)
> standards:   ERC-20 | ERC-721 | ERC-1155 | SPL
> extras:      zk-SNARKs | Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) | MEV Defense
```

### `mission`

> *to make blockchains disappear into pure experience*
> people see value, not networks
> credentials, not chains
> trust, not buzzwords
